This code is a Streamlit app for summarizing either user-input text or uploaded PDF documents. Let's go through it step by step:

1. **Imports:**
   - `streamlit` is used to create interactive web applications with Python.
   - `PdfReader` from `PyPDF2` is used to extract text from PDF files.
   - `pipeline` from `transformers` is used to perform text summarization using a pre-trained model.

2. **Streamlit Configuration:**
   - `st.set_page_config(layout="wide")`: Sets the layout of the page to be wide.

3. **Text Summarization Function:**
   - `@st.cache_resource`: This is a decorator used for caching the resource, which helps improve the performance by avoiding redundant computations.
   - `text_summary` function uses the Hugging Face Transformers library's pre-trained summarization model to generate a summary of the input text.

4. **PDF Text Extraction Function:**
   - `extract_text_from_pdf`: This function takes a file path to a PDF and extracts the text from the first page using `PyPDF2`.

5. **User Choice:**
   - `choice = st.radio("Select your choice", ["Summarize Text", "Summarize Document"])`: Displays a radio button for the user to choose between summarizing text or a document.

6. **Summarize Text Section:**
   - If the user chooses "Summarize Text":
     - `input_text = st.text_area("**Enter your text here**")`: Provides a text area for the user to input the text.
     - `if st.button("Summarize Text"):`: Checks if the "Summarize Text" button is clicked.
       - If the button is clicked, it checks if the input text is not empty, and if not, it generates a summary using the `text_summary` function and displays the result.

7. **Summarize Document Section:**
   - If the user chooses "Summarize Document":
     - `input_file = st.file_uploader("Upload your document here", type=['pdf'])`: Provides a file uploader for the user to upload a PDF document.
     - If a file is uploaded and the "Summarize Document" button is clicked:
       - It saves the uploaded file as "doc_file.pdf".
       - Extracts text from the PDF file using `extract_text_from_pdf`.
       - Generates a summary using `text_summary`.
       - Displays the document summary and the extracted text in an expander if the user clicks to expand.


1. **Streamlit:**
   - **Purpose:** Streamlit is a Python library designed for creating web applications with minimal effort.
   - **Functionality in the Code:** Streamlit is used to define the user interface, manage user input (text or file upload), and display the summarization results. It simplifies the process of turning data scripts into shareable web apps.

2. **Hugging Face Transformers:**
   - **Purpose:** Hugging Face Transformers is an open-source library that provides pre-trained models for natural language processing tasks.
   - **Functionality in the Code:** The code leverages the `transformers` library from Hugging Face to access a pre-trained summarization model. This model is used to generate concise summaries of input text, making the text summarization process efficient and accessible.

3. **PyPDF2:**
   - **Purpose:** PyPDF2 is a Python library for reading and manipulating PDF files.
   - **Functionality in the Code:** PyPDF2 is employed to extract text from the first page of a PDF document. This functionality is crucial for summarizing the content of uploaded PDF files in the "Summarize Document" section of the application.

4. **Python (Programming Language):**
   - **Purpose:** Python is a versatile, high-level programming language used for various applications, including web development, data analysis, and machine learning.
   - **Functionality in the Code:** Python serves as the primary programming language for developing the entire application. It is used to define functions, manage logic flow, and interact with the underlying libraries and frameworks.

5. **Caching with `@st.cache_resource`:**
   - **Purpose:** Caching is employed to store and reuse the results of resource-intensive operations, enhancing the performance of the application by avoiding redundant computations.
   - **Functionality in the Code:** The `@st.cache_resource` decorator is used to cache the results of the `text_summary` function, reducing the computational load when the same input text is summarized multiple times.

In summary, the application combines the simplicity of Streamlit for web development, the power of Hugging Face Transformers for text summarization, and the functionality of PyPDF2 for extracting text from PDF documents. Python serves as the backbone, facilitating the integration of these technologies and allowing for the creation of an effective and user-friendly text summarization web application.

Overall, this code creates a simple web application using Streamlit to allow users to either input text for summarization or upload a PDF document for summarization. It uses the Hugging Face Transformers library for text summarization and PyPDF2 for PDF text extraction.
