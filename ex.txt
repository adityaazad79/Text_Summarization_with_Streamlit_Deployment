As the leads indicate big win for the BJP in three heartland states - Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan - workers were seen celebrating at party offices. In Telangana, K Chandrasekhar Rao-led BRS has accepted defeat against the Congress. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to address the party workers at the party headquarters in Delhi at around 6.30 pm. BJP leaders credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, Amit Shah's strategy and party's welfare policies for the positive trends that show a clear victory for the party in three states. The opposition, however, claims that the results will not have any impact on the Lok Sabha elections in 2024.

Five states - Mizoram, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Telangana went to polls this year, which is being viewed as the semi-final to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The Election Commission of India has, however, revised the date for counting of votes for Mizoram where voting was conducted on November 7.

While voting was held in Madhya Pradesh on November 17. Rajasthan and Telangana voted in a single phase on November 25 and November 30 respectively. Chhattisgarh voted on November 7 and November 17.
